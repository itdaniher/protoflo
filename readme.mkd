### protoflo

This branch contains the development files for the only Poi head to move like you do. 

Protoflo contains a high-speed accelerometer monitoring your spin, changing color and pattern hundreds of times a second. It's 100% open and designed to be hackable, giving you the power to map moves to patterns and speed to color. 

Protoflo also charges over USB, keeping you green.
